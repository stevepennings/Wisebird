### Setup

##### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed a version of Node.js supported by Polymer. To check the version of Node.js that you have installed, run:

    node --version

update NPM

    npm install npm@latest -g

Ensure that Git is installed. (otherwise you can download the project from: https://github.com/stevepennings/wisebird.git, instead of cloning the repository)

    git --version

Install Polymer CLI

    npm install -g polymer-cli

Install the latest version of Bower

    npm install -g bower

##### Clone or download the project

    git clone https://github.com/stevepennings/wisebird.git

    OR:

    Download link: 
    https://github.com/stevepennings/wisebird/archive/master.zip

##### Install NPM and used Webcomponents

    npm install
    bower install

### Start the development server

This command serves the app at `http://127.0.0.1:8081` and provides basic URL
routing for the app:

    polymer serve -o
